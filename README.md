# duggirala-piping-map-reduce
I am practising mapping and reducing.

# Type of data
For this assignment I have used the dataset that gives the list of top companies that has the following columns: country name, company name, sales, profits, asserts and market value. Since 2003 this data set gives the list for about 12 months in the year 2021.

# Analysis
I have six columns in the data set by using the mapping techinque I reduced it into two columns and by using the sorting technique, sorted the output by country names in the alphabetical order.
